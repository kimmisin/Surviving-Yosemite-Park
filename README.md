# Surviving-Yosemite-Park
2D platform survival game in Processing Java language\
Upon start of the Processing file, the user sees a menu screen with buttons to see the game instructions, mute sound, view the high score list, or play the game. When “Play” is chosen, a random map out of 3 varying difficulty candidates is chosen for the game.  Once the game starts, the player spawns on a random map with 5 lives.  The player can move around the map and the screen follows.  Obstacles (logs, rocks, and bears) randomly spawn on the screen and the player can jump, dodge, or shoot to avoid them.  The player must collect stars to get points.  Every 1000 points, the user is boosted to the next level where obstacles spawn faster and more often.  Touching the water is instant death.  This game doesn’t have a specific win condition, and instead the player shoots for a high score.  High scores are displayed once the player dies. Pause functionality is also included during gameplay.
