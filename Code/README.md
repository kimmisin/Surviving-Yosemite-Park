### All Code Files

For code reading without downloading the zip file.
The cs324e_finalproject.pde file is the main sketch, and all other .pde files are classes.

The scores.json file is required for high score memory and tracking. It is updated via the Savefile class.

All of these files are provided in the cs324e_finalproject.zip file in the main directory for easy download and play. A README.txt file is included to instruct folder navigation, updating the Processing environment (if sound library is not installed), and game play instructions.
